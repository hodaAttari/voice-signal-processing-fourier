# Voice Signal Processing — Fourier & Filtering  

This project demonstrates fundamental **Digital Signal Processing (DSP)** techniques for audio signals using Python, NumPy, and SciPy.  
The code performs reading, transforming, filtering, speed manipulation, reversal, and mixing of `.wav` files — all from scratch with detailed visual plots.


## Operations Implemented  

It performs step‑by‑step:
- Reading and FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) of WAV files  
- Spectrogram visualization and amplitude‑frequency analysis  
- Low‑pass filtering of noisy signals using custom cut‑off ranges  
- Speed modification (slow / fast playback)  
- Voice reversal for time domain inversion  
- Mixing multiple signals with resampling to a common rate  


## Files  

`project-voice.ipynb` — Main notebook with all visualizations and plots  
`cleanpotc.wav` — Cleaned signal after Fourier low‑pass filtering  
`fastpotc.wav` — Example of speed‑up version (×2 playback)  
Additional files generated: `slowpotc.wav`, `revpotc.wav`, `mixpotc.wav`


## Run  

Install required packages:
```bash
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib
```

Run the notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook project-voice.ipynb
```
Output Examples
During execution, the notebook produces plots such as:

Amplitude–Frequency curve before and after filtering

Spectrogram (time–frequency intensity map)

Reconstructed clean audio using inverse FFT

Audio output with different playback rates

Mixed signal plot showing combined frequency spectrum


Educational Goal
This mini‑project helps students understand how digital audio processing works —

how frequency‑domain manipulation (Fourier & filters) relates to time‑domain signal changes.

It bridges theory (FFT & filtering) to real‑world practice (cleaning, speed change, mixing).
