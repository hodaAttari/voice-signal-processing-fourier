# Voice Signal Processing â€” Fourier & Filtering  

This project demonstrates fundamental **Digital Signal Processing (DSP)** techniques for audio signals using Python, NumPy, and SciPy.  
The code performs reading, transforming, filtering, speed manipulation, reversal, and mixing of `.wav` files â€” all from scratch with detailed visual plots.


## Operations Implemented  

It performs stepâ€‘byâ€‘step:
- Reading and FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) of WAV files  
- Spectrogram visualization and amplitudeâ€‘frequency analysis  
- Lowâ€‘pass filtering of noisy signals using custom cutâ€‘off ranges  
- Speed modification (slow / fast playback)  
- Voice reversal for time domain inversion  
- Mixing multiple signals with resampling to a common rate  


## Files  

`project-voice.ipynb` â€” Main notebook with all visualizations and plots  
`cleanpotc.wav` â€” Cleaned signal after Fourier lowâ€‘pass filtering  
`fastpotc.wav` â€” Example of speedâ€‘up version (Ã—2 playback)  
Additional files generated: `slowpotc.wav`, `revpotc.wav`, `mixpotc.wav`


## Run  

Install required packages:
```bash
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib
```

Run the notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook project-voice.ipynb
```
Output Examples
During execution, the notebook produces plots such as:

Amplitudeâ€“Frequency curve before and after filtering
Spectrogram (timeâ€“frequency intensity map)
Reconstructed clean audio using inverse FFT
Audio output with different playback rates
Mixed signal plot showing combined frequency spectrum


ðŸŽ¯ Educational Goal
This miniâ€‘project helps students understand how digital audio processing works â€”

how frequencyâ€‘domain manipulation (Fourier & filters) relates to timeâ€‘domain signal changes.

It bridges theory (FFT & filtering) to realâ€‘world practice (cleaning, speed change, mixing).
